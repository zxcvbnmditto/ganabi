# Ganabi
This is the research framework of Ganabi challenge owned by the UCD Josh Lab.

## Phase One

### Description
In the first project, we will be creating a baseline agent that is aimed to be simple but representative. The model will be limited to using only MLP, and we will try to obtain better result by applying fundamental machine learning techniques.

### Learning Focus
Here is a list of techniques that we might want to get familiar with. Feel free to add more
- Tensorflow 2.0 framework
- Keras API
- Tensorflow Dataset API
- Cross Validation
- Regularization
- Effective Matplotlib Data Visualization
